Camped at our field site on the shore of Ellesmere Island, I got up every morning last summer and stared out at the Arctic Ocean. I would see ringed seals, king eiders, long-tailed ducks, polar bears, and snow geese. But as the weeks wore on and geese and ducks taught their young to fly, something was missing. Arctic terns migrate past my house in Vancouver in the spring and fall; I was still waiting for them in July at 80ºN.

Near shore and far out on the high seas, the surface of the ocean is shouting and screeching, alive as seabirds swoop and dive for pelagic fish swimming up at the surface. Or at least it used to be. We have [70% fewer seabirds](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129342) than we did in 1950, and the arctic tern is one of those majestic species that is now in decline.

Today, the shining sea surface sounds more like the drum of engines and the clank of trawling nets than it does the calls of albatross, terns, and puffins. Like many marine species in decline, those industrial fishing boats present a huge threat to seabirds. [Seabirds are caught](https://fisheries.noaa.gov/national/science-data/seabirds) as bycatch in non-selective fisheries, snared in nets, and dragged up by hook-and-line fishing when they dive for fishing bait (food). Researchers have suggested that marine protected areas (MPAs) create areas for seabirds to roost and feed without the dangers of fishing. Implementing well-enforced MPAs along migratory roots will take life-threatening pressures off the arctic tern and other migratory seabirds–and [promote fisheries recovery](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/mpa-zpm/index-eng.html). Excitingly, machine learning is now being applied to [predict the distribution of seabirds](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.816794/full), giving us valuable insights into what places are important to protect.

Seabirds also face significant risks on land. Many seabirds are long lived species which reproduce slowly and bear just 1-2 eggs each year. Invasive species like rats, goats, and raccoons have become a critical threat to sea birds, as these animals [rob nests](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719307499) of eggs and chicks. However this can be fought: in Mexico, habitat restoration and invasive species eradication are promoting [a huge rebound in seabird populations](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/mexicos-conservation-efforts-spur-dramatic-recoveries-for-20-species-of-seabirds/).

Weeks into the field season I awoke to a new bird call–I heard the terns before I saw them. Out over the ice few dozen small, black capped birds dove, hovered, and fished the nearshore shallows in that fabulous way terns do. In less than a week they were gone again.

Seabirds consume most pelagic species of small fish and zooplankton, and are food for marine and coastal animals from every kingdom. Networked throughout oceanic food webs, they are a vital part of marine biodiversity. New conservation work shows that we need to stop [the killing of birds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719307499) at the source–that is, we must make space for birds to migrate and reproduce away from industrial fisheries and invasive hunters. To learn more about (or get involved with!) seabird conservation efforts in Canada, have a look at [Birds Canada](https://www.birdscanada.org/bird-science/seabird-projects) and the [Pacific Seabird Group](https://pacificseabirdgroup.org/).
